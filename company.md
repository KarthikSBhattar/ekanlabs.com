## History

---

Ekanlabs was founded in 2021 with the goal of revolutionizing AI models by introducing newfound scalability and speed. We quickly formed a team and began building a prototype to validate the feasibility of this technology on NISQ (Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum) devices. Soon, we began experimenting with scalability and comparing it to classical devices.

We are now looking to expand globally and need your help to spread the word. We firmly believe that this technology has the potential to revolutionize the field of AI.
