## Introduction

---

The realm of quantum computing has witnessed remarkable advancements in recent years, with computing becoming increasingly sophisticated in their ability to mitigate errors and provide. Quantum computing has emerged as a revolutionary technology with the potential to solve complex computational problems that are beyond the reach of classical computers.

## Company logisitics

Logistics problems are common issues with companies. These problems require an immense amount of compute and take hours on hand to solve. Fortunately, Quantum computing presents a solution that can instantaneously solve such problems. Our experiments found it to be thousands of times faster for complex problems. Now it is our goal to provide such a service to the public.

## Understanding Quantum Computing:

Quantum computing operates on the principles of quantum mechanics, leveraging quantum bits or qubits to process and store information. Unlike classical bits, which can represent either a 0 or a 1, qubits can exist in multiple states simultaneously, thanks to a phenomenon known as superposition. This property allows quantum computers to perform computations in parallel and potentially solve certain problems exponentially faster than classical computers.

## Quantum AI

AI requires a large amount of compute. GPUs brought about parallel processing but it seems as if we are hitting a brick wall. Currently, the most popular AI models from OpenAI required thousands of GPUs and several thousand megawatts of electricity. In the near future QML will be stable enough so that we can break the quadrillion parameter barrier.
