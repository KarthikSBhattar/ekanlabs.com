# Energy efficiency with QML

Quantum Machine Learning (QML) is a promising approach to achieve energy efficiency. This is because QML can solve complex optimization problems with fewer computational resources than classical computing. By using QML, we can develop intelligent systems that perform tasks such as energy management, optimization of renewable energy sources, and predictive maintenance of energy systems. These systems have the potential to reduce energy consumption and costs while increasing the reliability and sustainability of energy systems.

QML also has the potential to create conventional models like language models, vision transformers, etc.. 

## The true scale of QML

QML is several ****************million**************** times more powerful than classical ML. This allows us to do things like real-time inferencing which can be used for stock prediction or self-driving cars. QML has also proven to be superior to classical ML is vision oriented tasks due to its circuit nature.

This inferencing speed up results in a much faster training time when compared to traditional ML.
